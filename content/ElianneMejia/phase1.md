## Phase 1 Delivereable
One thing that has really stood out to me throughout the trip so far is the Beguinage we visited. I was not aware that these existed before the tour. Although I knew women had limited freedom during the time period, I never really considered what ways there were for women to gain independence. I like the idea of them having a safe haven where they can go to live so they can work and live independently. I think the building itself is beautiful and I think it's great that the building was preserved and turned into student housing. As for my contribution to the phase 1 deliverable:  I helped my group finalize our project idea, find data sources, and write our project description. Additionally, I wrote four user stories for the refugee persona.
